			<p>So what is a <b>variable in JavaScript</b>?</p>
			<p>Do you remember school algebra? x = 1, y = 2 ...</p>
			<p>In particular, a letter (for example "x") could be used to store a variable value (for example "1").</p>
			<p>These letters are called <b>variables</b>, and <b>variables</b> can be used to store values.</p>
			<p>Putting a value in a variable is called "<b>assigning</b>" a value, this is done using the "=" operation. (It should not be confused with the comparison operation - the "==" operation is used in JavaScript.) During the execution of this operation, the value of the expression located to the right of the "=" sign is assigned to the variable located to the left of the "=" sign. For example, the expression "x = 1" assigns the value "1" to the variable "x", the expression "x = y" assigns the value from the variable "y" to the variable "x" , and the expression "x = x + 1" assigns the same value increased by one to the variable "x".</p>
			<p><b>Variables in JavaScript</b> , as well as in algebra, are used to store values ​​or expressions.</p>
			<p><b>Variable can have a name</b>, for example "x", or a more informative name, for example "myPetName".</p>
			<p>There is a set of rules for naming JavaScript variables:
			 <ul>
			 	<li>Variable names are <b>case-sensitive</b> (y and Y are two different variables).</li>
			    <li>Variable names<b>must start with a letter or with one of the characters: "$" and"_"</b></li>
			    <li>The variable name<b>can consist of any numbers and letters of the Latin alphabet, as well as the characters "$" and"_"</b></li>
			    <li>You <b>can not use reserved words or keywords</b> as variable names</li>
			  </ul>
		    </p>
		    <p>Keywords in JavaScript :</p>
		    <pre><span class="blue__color__text"> break, delete,function,</span><span class="purple__color__text"> return, typeof, case, do, if, switch, var, catch, else, in, this, void, continue, false,<br> instanceof, throw, while, debugger, finally, new, true, with, default, for, null, try</span> </pre>
		    <p>There are also reserved words in JavaScript that are not part of the language, but can become part of it the future (according to the ECMA-262 standard):</p>
		    <pre><span class="blue__color__text"> class</span>,<span class="purple__color__text"> const, enum, export</span>, <span class="blue__color__text">extends</span>, <span  class="purple__color__text">import, super</span>
		    </pre>
		    <p>It is not recommended and sometimes not allowed to use the following words as identifiers:</p>
		    <pre>implements, <span class="blue__color__text">let</span>, private, public, <span class="blue__color__text">yield</span>, interface, package, protected, <span class="blue__color__text">static</span></pre>
		    <p>The value of a variable can change during the execution of the script, you can also access it by name to perform various actions with its contents.</p>
