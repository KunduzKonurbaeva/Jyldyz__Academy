		</div>

		<div class="content__container__box">
			<p><b>JavaScript</b> is a programming language that is executed on the user's side using a browser. It allows you to control the elements of a web page - to make them change their properties and location, move, react to events such as moving a mouse or pressing a keyboard, and create many other interesting effects</p>
			<p><b>JavaScript</b>  is often abbreviated to <b>JS</b>, which is often used in the names of different frameworks (Node.js, Ember.js) and also in the extension of files with JavaScript code.</p>
			<p><b>JavaScript</b>  as a name is a registered trademark and belongs to the company <span class="red__color__text">ORACLE</span>.</p>

Previously, it was called LiveScript and was developed jointly by <span class="green__color__text">Netscape Communications</span> and <span class="green__color__text">Sun Microsystems</span> as a language for managing elements and ensuring the interaction of constituent parts of web resources - images, plug-ins, Java applets and other elements used for creating web pages.</p>
